# Document-Processing-Tool-Search_engine
In this project I am used the concepts of data structures course to build a real world system to solve a real world problem. In particular, in this project I build a natural
language-based question answering system that will process given corpus of documents (say complete works
of Mahatama Gandhi) and answer any question posed by the user in natural language. My system is
expected to answer the questions using the corpus of documents provided by you.
In this project I am created a search engine that will return all matching answers to an input query in
the corpus provided, similar to they way search engines return the results. The input query may start from middle of a word and end at the
middle of a word, yet you are expected to return all the sentences in the given corpus that match your input
query. There will be marks for correctness as well as efficiency if your implementation. In addition, I am created a dictionary that counts the number of occurrences of each word in the given corpus.
